                For the first 4 months of my 8-month co-op, I worked as a Student Consultant at the University of
                Guelph. In this blog, I aim to share the experiences I've gained, the skills I've developed, and the
                challenges I've faced so far in this role. Whether you're interested in IT support, exploring co-op
                opportunities, or just curious about what it's like working in this position, I aim to provide valuable
                insights. My goal is to emphasize the importance of technical knowledge, effective communication, and
                teamwork in a university environment.
